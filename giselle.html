  <div class="container overflow-auto col-sm-6 bg-dark text-white" style="max-height: 260px"><p></p><p><b>Giselle</b> is Follia’s younger brother, once known as Passacaglia. Passacaglia was murdered by Follia for his betrayal: giving Follia's name, and thus his autonomy, to a dangerous hag. However, a mysterious individual known as The Collector brought him back to life. The newly-revived elf named himself Giselle, and started to grow stronger, becoming an assassin working under The Collector.</p>
<p>Giselle often seems cold and emotionless, though polite. Truthfully this is because he is a dhampir that feeds off psychic energy. Showing (and occasionally feeling) emotion has become harder for him, though occasionally some bits slip through the cracks.</p>
  <p>Though Follia was the one that killed Giselle, the two have reconciled beyond death and are learning how to be brothers again. Giselle is so much more cheerful and energetic when he is with his brother. He also worries for Follia's safety, and he wants to get strong enough to protect Follia himself (even despite the fact that Follia is extremely powerful.)</p>
